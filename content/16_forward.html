<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
<p>With a new Executive Director in place, we are even more excited about Bike & Build's future and the continued reach and impact of the organization. Our existing strategic plan serves as a firm foundation upon which to build, from our focus on rider safety and support for the affordable housing cause to increased alumni engagement and continuing to tell our inspirational story. We invite you to join us in 2017 and beyond!
