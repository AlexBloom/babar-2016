North Shore Development Coalition (Salem, MA)
- $10,000
– Coastal Drift
<p>North Shore CDC’s YouthBuild program prepares youth for workplace success in construction while also supporting leadership development and civic engagement. YouthBuild students build affordable housing in their communities, while completing the HiSet program to obtain a GED. With the 2016 grant from Bike & Build’s Coastal Drift trip, North Shore CDC will support two green certification trainings for YouthBuild participants - weatherization and green construction - providing advanced training and expertise in a growing employment sector.

<blockquote>“Our YouthBuild students are supported by Bike & Build financially and through volunteerism. Each year, your grant allows our students to further their education through construction certifications or providing a teaching opportunity such as guest speakers coming to their classes or site visits to colleges. Bike & Build allows us the opportunity to complete more build day projects by attending one of these events and shows our students the joy that can come from volunteerism.”
